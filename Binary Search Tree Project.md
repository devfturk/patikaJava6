# Binary Search Tree Project

<h3>The Binary Search Tree (BST) stages for the sequence [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] are as follows:</h3>

---
1. Create the root node with the value 7.

2. Insert 5 to the left of the root.

3. Insert 1 to the left of 5.

4. Insert 8 to the right of the root.

5. Insert 6 to the right of 5.

6. Insert 3 to the right of 1.

7. Insert 0 to the left of 1.

8. Insert 9 to the right of 8.

9. Insert 4 to the right of 3.

10. Insert 2 to the left of 3.

<h2>The resulting Binary Search Tree would look like this:</h2>

            7
          /   \
         5     8
        / \     \
       1   6     9
      / \
     0   3
        / \
       2   4
